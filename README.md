# ERC-20 Token Project
Project: Create and Mint Token

## Description

This project focuses on creating an ERC-20 token, a widely adopted standard for implementing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 token allows for functionalities such as token transfers, token burning, and minting.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm should be installed on your machine.

### Executing Program

Follow the steps below to execute the program:

1. Open the Remix IDE by visiting [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Open the ERC-20 token contract in the Remix IDE.
3. In the terminal, run the `npx hardhat node` command.
4. In the Remix IDE, change the environment to "hardhat" to connect to the local network.
5. Compile and deploy the ERC-20 token contract using Remix.
6. Once the contract is deployed, you can perform various operations such as:
  - A new token is created on the local HardHat network
  - Only the contract owner should be able to mint tokens
  - Any user can transfer tokens
  - Any user can burn tokens
7. You can use different accounts to perform burning and transferring operations.
